    <h1>Brewing on the Anvil Foundry - 10.5gal</h1>

    <button>Cheers!</button>
<p>The first and most time consuming part of electric brewing is heating up my mash water, so it is a good idea to do this in advance. For a midday brew, I’ll usually set up my system and get the water going with my first cup of coffee, and then leave it be until I am ready to brew. There is also a time-delay setting on this system which many folks will utilize before going to sleep (for a morning brew) or before going to work (for an afternoon brew).</p>
<p>I know my system can only handle a maximum of 7.5 gallons of mash water, so I will usually fill this amount by default and set the temp to about 155° for a target mash temp of 149°. Of course, adjust according to your recipe and desired mash temperature. I’ll add my water adjustments at this point so when it is time to brew, it is time to brew. Before walking away to let the water heat up, put the grain basket back in so everything is at the right temp.</p>
<p>Note: If my recipe calls for a sparge, I will fill the Anvil up to 9.5 gallons and pull off the extra volume prior to mashing.  This is for the purpose of being able to add all water adjustments at one time. This will only be beneficial if you can fit 100% of your total water before mashing in.</p>
<p>When I am ready to brew, I’ll weigh out my grains, pull off any additional sparge water (see note), set the temperature to my desired mash temperature, and mash in! Stir that puppy up and make sure there are no dough balls (clumps with dry grain on the inside), put the lid on and set your timer accordingly. More often than not I’ll do a 30 minute mash, switching on the pump (with the strainer lid above the basket) at the 15 minute mark. Adjust the flow of your pump accordingly.</p>
<p>Note: Make sure your brewing software is set to your intended mash and boil times when creating your recipes. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLXh0bxYbHg">this link </a> to watch <a href="https://brulosophy.com/">Brulosophy</a>'s tutorial on my preferred app, Brewfather.</p>
<p>Note: If you are sparging, you will want to heat up your sparge water to 175° or higher, during the mash so it is ready to go. I am also usually cleaning kegs/fermenters during idle time throughout the brewing process.</p>
<p>Other things to do during idle time:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Have a beer</li>
    <li>Clean stuff</li>
    <li>Get next ingredients (water, hops, soap, sanitizer) ready</li>
    <li>Have a beer</li>
    <li>Clean stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>After the mash, it is time to turn the pump off and lift up the basket. A step stool and/or another person and/or a pulley system are very helpful for this step. Once the basket is resting atop the kettle to drain, you can turn your temperature setting up to a boil. It is usually worthwhile to mix around the grains to ensure all your wort drains out. This is also the time to sparge if your recipe calls for it.</p>
<p>Note: When mixing around the grains to extract maximum wort, hold the basket or ask a friend to do so, as it may accidentally slip back into the hot wort.
  <p>Once you reach your target pre-boil volume, remove the basket and put the lid on to help reach a boil faster. Again, there will usually be chores to do while you wait, but also, get your hops ready and stay close by in case of a boil over.</p>
  <p>From here on out, this is like any other brew day.  Add your hops in your desired amounts at the desired times.  Add your wort chiller (if applicable) at the 15 minute mark to sterilize it, and turn it on after your boil. Rack the wort into your fermenter(s), pitch the yeast, clean up and have a beer!</p>
